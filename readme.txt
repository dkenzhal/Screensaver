Press "LEFT"  to change the color of the last selected node.

Double click to change shape. I added a circle as a new shape.

Press "RIGHT" to add a child to the node.
Since it hasn't been specified where and how we can add a child, I always add a child on the top of the shape with the same size and color as its parent, so that we can change them afterwards.
(So, if shape is upside down, the child will appear at the bottom of it, cause shape's top is now looking down.
Also pressing twice will create another child on the top of the previous one, so that we can drag the nodes to desired place after creation)

Press "UP" & "DOWN" to change the size.

Type "make run" to compile & run.
