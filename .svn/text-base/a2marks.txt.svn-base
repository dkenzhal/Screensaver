CS349 ASSIGNMENT 3 MARKING SCHEME
Marker : Mingyu

GUIDELINES
The assignment needs to compile and run in order for the TA to mark it. If it 
doesn't compile, but the TA is able to get it working, you will only lose marks 
for the "Compiles and runs" section. If they cannot get it to compile, you 
receive zero for the assignment.

MARKS
[5/5%]   Compiles and runs
    [/5]   'make run' compiles and runs; readme.txt exists with appropriate information

[20/20%]  Animating the scene graph
    [/10]   Nodes rotate about their parent
    [/5]    Nodes maintain the same face towards their parent
    [/5]    Moving the mouse on/off the window stops/starts the animation

[30/30%]  Dragging nodes
    [/10]   Dragging nodes follows the mouse accurately at all times
    [/5]    Dragging a parent node also drags the children, without changing their 
            relative positions 
    [/10]   Dragging a child node maintains the same face towards its parent at all times
    [/5]    Dragging a grandchild maintains the same face towards its parent at all times

[/45%]  Other manipulations
    [5/5]    Individual nodes can be scaled
    [2/5]    Scaling interaction uses direct manipulation that is easy to discover and use
            4' if slider is used
            4' if menu is used
            2' if keyboard is used 
    [5/5]    Scaling does not affect other nodes

    [5/5]    New child nodes can be added to any existing node
    [2/5]    New node interaction uses direct manipulation that is easy to discover and use
           2' if keyboard is used 

    [5/5]    The shape of a node can be  changed
    [1/5]    The change shape interaction uses direct manipulation that is easy to discover and use
            1' if cycling is used

    [5/5]    The colour of a node can be changed
    [1/5]    The change colour interaction uses direct manipulation that is easy to discover and use
            3' if only a limit number of colours (<8)
            1' if cycling is used

[0/10%]  Bonus Enhancement
    [/10]   An enhancement that is consistent with the purposes of the assignment is implemented.
            Marks awarded based on innovation and effort.
            (Marked based on Innovation AND Effort)
            7' high innovation low effort XOR low innovation high effort
            3' low innovation low effort

[0/10%]  Deduction
    [/10]   Each node holds its scaling, rotation, and translation information in a single
            AffineTranform instance variable.  It does not use extra matrices nor instance variables
            for that purpose.
